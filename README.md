# Sports Club Database Management System

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive database management system for Barcelona Sports Club. The system is built to efficiently manage athletes, staff, venues, teams, training sessions, matches, trophies, and contracts. The database was designed using the Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) and implemented using SQL, ensuring optimal data storage, retrieval, and management.

## Key Features
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Visual representation of entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Logical Design:** Mapped conceptual design to a structured relational schema using a 7-step algorithm.
- **SQL Implementation:** Created tables, inserted data, and executed complex queries for data validation.
- **Data Normalization:** Ensured data integrity and minimized redundancy.

## Entities
The database includes the following entities:
- **Athlete:** Manages player profiles, including personal details, medical records, and contracts.
- **Staff:** Handles employee roles, qualifications, and contracts.
- **Venue:** Tracks club facilities like stadiums, gyms, and cafeterias.
- **Team:** Organizes sport-specific teams, leagues, and standings.
- **Training Session & Drill:** Manages training schedules and exercises.
- **Match & Statistics:** Records game details, scores, and player performance.
- **Trophy:** Tracks awards won by teams and athletes.
- **Contract:** Manages employment agreements for staff and athletes.

## SQL Queries
The project includes 20+ SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval, such as:
- Updating salaries for high-performing staff.
- Retrieving match statistics with referee ratings.
- Adjusting release clauses for top athletes.
- Identifying expired staff certifications.
- Listing training sessions by venue.

## Installation
1. **Database Setup:** Execute the provided SQL scripts to create tables and insert sample data.
2. **Query Execution:** Run the SQL queries to test the system's functionality.

## Usage
- Use the queries to manage club operations, such as:
  - Tracking athlete performance.
  - Scheduling training sessions.
  - Managing staff contracts.
  - Analyzing match results.
